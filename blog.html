        <h4>The Adult stage for computers</h4>
        <p class="date">20 February, 2016</p>
        <p class="text"> <h2> We all have a love-hate relationship with screens. </h2>

<p>You might experience that frustrating feeling quite often : you’re talking to someone, who’s not really paying attention because they are looking at their smartphone or computer. It can be infuriating, and it’s mostly rude, but it’s not necessarily this person’s fault. We do live surrounded by screens that are made for one user only. <br> </p>

<p> Don’t get me wrong, I love being able to access any information on my smartphone. I spend hours on the internet every day, working, talking, sharing, learning, or just browsing ! But sometimes, that can drag me apart from the people around me. But, hey, “I’m just answering to that email real quick, and I’m yours”. This sentence became very common and socially acceptable. Just imagine that thirty years ago, it made absolutely no sense. <br>

Screens can be a barrier from the people around, they can be a barrier to exchange, they can be a barrier to efficient coworking, they can be a barrier to productivity! <br> </p>

<p> Our beloved and hated screens are the evolution of the Personal Computers (PC). This amazing invention changed our lives 30 years ago. It was a true revolution, a machine could help us achieve any task, from basic calculation to outstanding creativity. It changed our relationship to technology forever. The combined geniuses of Apple and Microsoft shaped our perception of computers. And they changed the way people interact. Other tech companies stepped in afterwards, creating brilliant softwares and hardwares, but all within that initial paradigm that a computer is meant to be used by one person at a time. <br> </p>

<h2> From Kids to Teenagers to Adults </h2> <br>

<p> Think of the Macintosh as a young child, just learning to speak with you, human being. It was impressive for it’s age, but it now seems elementary. Think of all the things we now take for granted: emails synchronised  between devices, free messaging system, social media, real time information, Photoshop, etc. They all are to computers what creative writing is to pre-school: The next step. <br> </p>

<p>But today, we stand at the awkward teenager age, where computers are not really made for co-working, sharing, co-creating with people around you. They have softwares to do that, preferably with people far enough so you don’t have to talk to them in person. But the hardware itself is not designed for efficient coworking. <br> </p>

<p>It’s time the computer technology grows to the responsible adult stage, where screens and their content bring people together, where they create an intellectual and productive bond with others. We need computers to become more “multiple-users oriented”. We want them to overcome the limitation of screens and to better integrate into the material world as interactive devices. The first step in that direction was the tablets. Where the screen no longer had to be the vertical barrier it is on a Personal Computer. But tablets are not the final evolution of computing : technology can go further. <br> </p>

<p>Imagine a meeting where every participant can interact with the content, directly on the table or on the wall, as he would do on a large sheet of paper. You just grab a picture and change it, while I add some notes on that graph, and we can all review it together. People would feel implicated, included and motivated. <br>
</p>

<h2> Shared computers </h2><br>
<p>
The logical evolution from Personal Computer is Shared Computer. Technologically speaking, we have the means to reach that next step. The amazing concordance of projectors development, Internet network capacities, and software advancement opens a wide array of opportunities. We live in a world where a water heater can be connected to the internet. Why wouldn’t we be able to create a computer made for multiple users, that connect users not only virtually but also physically? <br></p>
<p>
And we need to make the leap to Shared Computers so the future won’t be like Pixar’s Wall-E, where people live through their screens, absolutely oblivious of their environment.  <br></p>

<p>

Sci-Fi movies and books have greatly inspired us, and can show a glimpse of what may come. Think of Minority Report’s Curved interactive screen. When the movie came out in 2002, this seemed like farfetch and fascinating technology we can only dream of. But the latest Televisions are curved, all of our devices are becoming tactile. Some prototypes or very exclusive meeting devices are already able to offer an user experience close to Minority Report’s. <br></p>
<p>
Even better, the amazing visual interface Tony Stark/Robert Downey Jr. used in Iron Man movies, allows them to manipulate objects, concepts and information with their body movements, like they would do with a book or a basket ball. Why would this be the realm of Sci-Fi? Hologram technology is rapidly progressing, as shown at the 2016 CES in Las Vegas. Widely-spread consoles like the Wii or the Xbox Kinect can already detect body movements. And there’s also Augmented Reality, like the Google Backed startup: Magic Leap who wants to bring magic back to the world.  <br></p>




<h2> What comes next? </h2> <br>
<p>
Our feelings towards technology are evolving. After the first “Wow moment” we had with computers and smartphones, we now are more demanding. We want technology to adapt to us, and not the other way around. <br>
<p>
What is yet to come is a truly adaptative, almost disappearing technology, even if always available. The perspicacity of the movie “Her” is that the most advanced tech gadgets is not tangible. It’s the ultimate computer, and yet, you can’t see it. <br></p>
<p>
We are on our way to an even more adaptive and subtile tech world, where we have the screen we need, when we need it. The car we need, when we need it, as Faraday ( http://www.faradayfuture.com/) explained at CES 2016. The adjectives that come to mind when describing the future of technology are smooth, discrete, personalised yet multi-users simultaneously. This technology must be open, inclusive, and related to environment. Isn’t that exciting? <br></p>
